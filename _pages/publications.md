**Tosolini, M., 'The First Oil Shock and the European Financial Assistance', _Economie & Institutions_, forthcoming.**

In this article, I study the negotiations and the implementation of the first borrowing mechanism of the European Economic Community (EEC). Using historical archives, I show that following the first oil shock, the Commission of the EEC sought to implement a European policy to tackle the economic effects of the schock. It played the role of a political entrepreneur and successed in imposing its views.


The Community Loan Mechanism was implemented in 1975, empowering the Commission to borrow money on the financial markets in order to grant loans to Member States facing balance of paymenets deficits due to the oil shock.


Consequently, the Commission became a supranational borrower on the international capital market (the euromarkets).
